Requirements
------------
This module requires Drupal 6.X.

Overview:
--------
Node Type Views creates teaser views and RSS feeds for published content
by content type. Node Type Views is meant to satisfy the basic need for
content type listings without using taxonomy workarounds and little
additional server-side processing. For anything more advanced the
views module is more appropriate.

Installation and configuration:
------------------------------
Simply extract the download package in your modules directory and 
then enable the module in 'admin/build/modules/'.
For configuration options go to 'admin/content/nodetypeviews'.
