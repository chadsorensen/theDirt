NICE MENUS UPGRADE
------------------
4.7 -> 5.x
The CSS class has changed to change the underscore (_) to a dash (-)
The 4.7 version of class="nice_menu" is now class="nice-menu" in version 5.
You will need to adjust any Custom CSS you have added to account for this.
The default CSS that comes with nice_menus uses this new convention already.

Also note that the layout CSS for the module has been broken out into a
separate CSS file (nice_menus_default.css). You have the option of replacing
this file by creating a separate customized CSS file, and overriding the
default CSS file at Administer -> Themes -> Configure -> Global settings ->
"Path to custom nice menus CSS file".
